# ubuntu problems ! written by [mahdic200](https://github.com/mahdic200)

in this series of Markdown Files , I've wrote a bunch of notes which are really handy ! . specially for beginners like us in ubuntu which are not comfortable without GUI .

there are many answers for questions like :
- how do I setup a proxy in my ubuntu ?
- how do I use clipboard ?
- how do I solve network issue with apt ?
- what is permission denied message ?
- why can't I login as root ?
- how to reset my password ?
- how do I reset root password ?

which are scattered throughout the web and finding them maybe overwhelming and annoying for starters and beginners . because many of users use windows as their desktop operating system and it's so user-friendly . but ubuntu and other linux distributions are for professionals and expert programmers . despite of this fact that ubuntu and other linux distributions become more user-friendly in recent few years .

# how to use this doc ?
I suggest you to use this documentation with obsidian software which is available , open-source and free . just google it :) .

you can use obsidian search tools like `ctrl + F` or `ctrl + shift + F` . it's so convenient ! .

have a great day and good luck ! .
